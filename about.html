<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!<br/>
My name is Abdelrahman Emad Keleg. I'm a dentist and a web developer from Alexandria, Egypt.<br/>
let me tell you how I got here exactly, one word; CURIOSITY. I love learning new skills and understanding as much as I can about everything, from a telescope watching stars collide to a microscope observing wonders inside our cells.
I read extensively in psychology, business, medicine, engineering, art and mythology. Along my learning journey the realization that everything around us is deeply connected to one another in ways we understand and ways we don't fuels my desire to keep learning.
<br/> I don't think I'll ever stop learning there is no destination in sight.
