<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<p>I have many hobbies and I love exploring new ones every once in a while i feel they give color to life.
  <br/>I love reading about everything recently I dove into psychology particulary Carl Jung, reading into marketing and economics and every there
  books or so I read a novel or a fiction book i think it helps with my creativity and imagination.
</p>

<p>I love capturing magical moments and freeze frames in time when I'm with my friends or travelling. I only recently
    picked up photography after I bought a professional camera and a macro lense for taking dental photos, only to find myself taking pictures
    of everything.

<p>On weekends I try to catch dinner for me and a couple of friends with a fishing rod and a rocking boat. lucky
    for them we get to eat most of the time. I think it's the perfect hobby! A couple of friends, on a boat drifting in the sea catching fish just when they were about to give up and order burgers. 
    then of course cooking and eating pretending they're Gordon Ramsay.

<p>Then there's chess. I am honestly convinced I discovered huge parts of myself and the way I think because of this beautiful game.
    Not because I'm great at it (I Am), but reflecting on my reaction to moves, how I solve my way out of a tough position and trying to analyze my games.
    Chess is not just pieces moving I believe it's a language you and your opponent are the only ones speaking.
